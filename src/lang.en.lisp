 ("I have  been introduced to  functional programming end of  2018 as our  team was
  given the task to develop a new internal front-end application with React.js. We
  were coached by an external professional every two weeks."
  "My interest for functional programming grew and  I started to "

  "Later on, a colleague  of mine told me about clojure so  passionately that I let
  haskell aside and started learning  Clojure! I did that “not-professionally” for
  a few month,  learned and practiced Clojure, reagent,  re-frame, compojure, ring
  (I might forget some). I made a  presentation about it at my company (the slides
  were a re-frame project  in order to demonstrate during my  speech). I even went
  to the “heart  of clojure” in Leuven,  Belgium, met a lot  of interesting people
  there! And since a  few weeks I learn common-lisp. What is there  more to say to
  show my tremendous interest in Lisp? Lisp is the ultimate weapon.")

 ("Free software is Love."
  "For a better quality, for more security and for a better respect of human rights. It is the way to go if we want to have a chance to evolve our consciousness as a society and as individuals."
  "I've been working in different areas. From computational biology in bio-image recognition to the space industry with the automation of the Galileo satellite fleet and the maintenance of ESA's SCOS-2000 and now in Finance, I've been through different aspects of developing IT products."
  "Communication with transparency and benevolance is the absolute must for a healthy work collaboration."
  "And Lisp is the fatal weapon.")
