 ("Free software is Love."
  "For a better quality, for more security and for a better respect of human rights. It is the way to go if we want to have a chance to evolve our consciousness as a society and as individuals."
  "I've been working in different areas. From computational biology in bio-image recognition to the space industry with the automation of the Galileo satellite fleet and the maintenance of ESA's SCOS-2000 and now in Finance, I've been through different aspects of developing IT products."
  "Communication with transparency and benevolance is the absolute must for a healthy work collaboration."
  "And Lisp is the fatal weapon.")
