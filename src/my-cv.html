   <p class=about-me>Free software is Love.
   <p class=about-me>For a better quality, for more security and for a better 
    respect of human rights. It is the way to go if we want to have a chance to 
    evolve our consciousness as a society and as individuals.
   <p class=about-me>I've been working in different areas. From computational 
    biology in bio-image recognition to the space industry with the automation of 
    the Galileo satellite fleet and the maintenance of ESA's SCOS-2000 and now in 
    Finance, I've been through different aspects of developing IT products.
   <p class=about-me>Communication with transparency and benevolance is the absolute 
    must for a healthy work collaboration.
   <p class=about-me>And Lisp is the fatal weapon.
